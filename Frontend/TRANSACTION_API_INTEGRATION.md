# Transaction API Integration

This document describes the integration of the transaction API with the frontend application.

## Overview

The transaction API has been successfully integrated into the frontend without modifying the backend. The integration includes:

1. **API Service Functions** - Added transaction-related functions to `src/services/api.js`
2. **Transaction History Component** - Created a reusable component for viewing transaction history
3. **Dashboard Integration** - Added transaction functionality to Cashier, Manager, and Admin dashboards
4. **POS System Integration** - Updated the cashier POS system to use the transaction API

## Backend API Endpoints Used

The following backend endpoints are utilized:

- `POST /api/transaction/add` - Add new transaction with multiple items
- `GET /api/transaction/list` - Get all transactions
- `GET /api/transaction/employee_transaction` - Get transactions by employee
- `GET /api/sale/list` - Get all sales
- `GET /api/sale/search` - Search sales by employee

## Frontend Components

### 1. API Service (`src/services/api.js`)

Added the following functions to the `salesAPI` object:

```javascript
// Add new transaction with multiple items
addTransaction: async (transactionData) => {
  const response = await api.post('/api/transaction/add', transactionData);
  return response.data;
}

// Get all transactions
getAllTransactions: async () => {
  const response = await api.get('/api/transaction/list');
  return response.data;
}

// Search transactions by employee
getEmployeeTransactions: async (employeeUsername) => {
  const response = await api.get('/api/transaction/employee_transaction', {
    data: { employee_username: employeeUsername }
  });
  return response.data;
}

// Get sales statistics with real data
getSalesStats: async () => {
  // Combines sales and transaction data for comprehensive statistics
}
```

### 2. Transaction History Component (`src/components/TransactionHistory.jsx`)

A reusable component that displays:
- Complete transaction history
- Search functionality by employee or sale ID
- Detailed view of each sale with individual transaction items
- Real-time data from the backend API

### 3. Dashboard Integration

#### Cashier Dashboard (`src/pages/CashierDashboard.jsx`)
- **POS System**: Updated to use `salesAPI.addTransaction()` instead of manual stock updates
- **Transaction History**: Added transactions tab with detailed history
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically refreshes transaction data after successful sales

#### Manager Dashboard (`src/pages/ManagerDashboard.jsx`)
- **Transactions Tab**: Added dedicated tab for viewing transaction history
- **Sales Analytics**: Enhanced with real transaction data

#### Admin Dashboard (`src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`)
- **Transactions Tab**: Added dedicated tab for viewing transaction history
- **Test Component**: Includes TransactionTest component for API testing

## Transaction Flow

### 1. POS Transaction Process

When a cashier processes a transaction:

1. **Cart Preparation**: Items are added to cart with quantities
2. **Transaction Data**: Cart is converted to backend format:
   ```javascript
   {
     employee: "Cashier Name",
     items: [
       { product_name: "Product1", quantity_sold: 2 },
       { product_name: "Product2", quantity_sold: 1 }
     ]
   }
   ```
3. **API Call**: `salesAPI.addTransaction()` is called
4. **Backend Processing**: Backend creates sale record and transaction records, updates stock
5. **Response Handling**: Frontend updates local state with new stock levels
6. **UI Updates**: Cart is cleared, success message shown, transaction history refreshed

### 2. Transaction History Display

The TransactionHistory component:
1. Fetches all transactions and sales from backend
2. Groups transactions by sale
3. Displays detailed information including:
   - Sale ID and date
   - Employee who processed the sale
   - Total amount and item count
   - Individual transaction items with quantities and prices

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:

- **API Errors**: Network errors and backend errors are caught and displayed
- **Validation**: Frontend validates cart data before sending to backend
- **Stock Validation**: Backend validates stock availability before processing
- **User Feedback**: Success and error messages are shown to users

## Testing

A TransactionTest component is included in the Admin Dashboard for testing:
- Tests all transaction API endpoints
- Validates API responses
- Provides console logging for debugging

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: All transactions are properly recorded in the backend
2. **Stock Management**: Automatic stock updates when transactions are processed
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for reporting and analysis
4. **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately after successful transactions
5. **Error Prevention**: Backend validation prevents invalid transactions

## Usage

### For Cashiers:
1. Add products to cart in POS system
2. Enter customer information (optional)
3. Click "Process Payment" to complete transaction
4. View transaction history in the Transactions tab

### For Managers/Admins:
1. Navigate to Transactions tab in dashboard
2. View complete transaction history
3. Search transactions by employee or sale ID
4. Monitor sales performance and trends

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the transaction system:
- Transaction filtering by date range
- Export transaction data to CSV/PDF
- Transaction receipt generation
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with accounting systems
