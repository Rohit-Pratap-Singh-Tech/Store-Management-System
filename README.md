🌟 About The Project

The Super Market Store Management System is a robust application built to handle all the complexities of a modern retail environment. It empowers different staff members—from cashiers to admins—with the tools they need to perform their jobs effectively. The system ensures data integrity with ACID-compliant transactions and provides a secure environment through JWT-based authentication and password hashing.

A standout feature is the interactive 2D map, which allows customers to easily locate products within the store, enhancing their shopping experience.

✨ Key Features

👤 Role-Based Access Control: Secure, distinct dashboards and permissions for Admins, Managers, Cashiers, and Inventory Managers.

📦 Real-Time Inventory Management: Track product stock, categories, locations, and receive low-stock alerts automatically.

💳 Efficient Sales Processing: A dedicated interface for cashiers to handle billing, record transactions, and generate receipts.

📊 Advanced Reporting & Analytics: Generate and export daily, weekly, or monthly reports on sales and inventory to monitor performance.

🗺️ Interactive 2D Customer Map: A unique feature for customers to visually locate products by store block (A, B, C).

🔐 Robust Security: Implements JWT for session management, password hashing, and role-based authorization to protect sensitive data.
